## What is QRF?
Quick Red Fox (QRF) is a new research tool developed to facilitate targeted in-the-moment interviews. QRF is an open-source server-client Android app. Specifically, QRF optimizes researcher time by directing interviewers to users that have just displayed an interesting behavior (previously defined by the research team). QRF integrates with existing student modeling technologies (e.g., behavior-sensing, affect-sensing, detection of self-regulated learning) to alert researchers to key moments in a user's experience. QRF listens for events (e.g., interaction patterns) and identifies moments of interest, prioritizes them, and directs interviewers accordingly, allowing the interviewer to record their interview directly in the app along with relevant metadata (e.g. participant ID).

## How has QRF been used?
The QRF method has led to several scientific papers, so far limited to examining self-regulation, affect, and the interplay between the two. It should be noted that this scope of inquiry is due to the research use case, rather than a limitation of the QRF Application.

 [Bosch et al., (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445809) used QRF interview transcripts to better understand metacognition and affect in AIEd technologies. This work leveraged the affect data collected as well as automatically analyzing interview transcripts for markers of metacognition.  Work by [Hutt et al., (2021)](https://sjhutt.com/img/papers/hutt_cogsci21.pdf) showed that QRF interviews could be combined with log data for more effective predictions of future self-regulated learning behaviors than if predicted from log data alone. These predictions were subsequently predictive of future learning, more so than log data. [Baker et al., (2021)](https://sjhutt.com/img/papers/baker_AIED21.pdf) used the data collected for an in-depth analysis of frustration in AIEd systems, considering both the causes and the effects of frustration in different students. Ocumpaugh et al., (2021) demonstrated the potential of targeted interviews for identifying "pain points" in the AIEd software and subsequent iterative design process, refining the design of Mr. Davis and Betty in ways that improved outcomes. Taken together, these articles demonstrate the wide potential of this data collection approach. By facilitating the collection of rich, time synchronized interviews with theoretically grounded triggers, we can pursue a wide variety of research questions.
