The app is good, but let's get that end button away from my big fat right thumb! Especially when I'm trying to 
hit stop-recording.  I know we have some constraints because of the text box, but let's try to move that 
like we did with HART. 

It might also be nice to be able to exit out of the "skip student" menu, because hitting the back button 
seems to induce crashes

Also, I walked across the hall yesterday, not knowing this would disconnect me from our server.  
Fortunately, Naveed panicked and checked, because it had disconnected.  Some sort of warning system on 
that might be good, though I realize this is probably a less trivial change than the other things.

I might have other ideas once we've actually been able to use it with a few more students, and again 
if we get ever get the patterns pushed automatically through the phone.

One quick thing--for the dummy variables that are there now.  Maybe something neutral?  Right now they say 
"boredom" and "confusion."  Since I'm kinda holding in students' faces to get the recording to work, it might 
be good do a quick change on this?  And in the future, we might want to think about abreviations that obscure 
that a bit.  Depending on the layout of a classroom we could even be worrying about nosy neighbors staring 
at the phone, which then becomes a different set of issues.
